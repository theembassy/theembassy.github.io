== Description ==

Log Lolla is a classic blog theme with brutalist design.

It brings back the joy of blogging and is meant to create knowledge from news.

It supports all default post formats—aside, gallery, link, image, quote, status, video, chat, audio—to let you freely add content. Whatever content you want.

Log Lolla aims to be the single destination, the hub of all content you publish on the web. Instead of scattering your thoughts, inspiration, fun, things to learn, status updates—you name it—on third party networks like Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram—you can collect them into a single space and distribute anywhere.
