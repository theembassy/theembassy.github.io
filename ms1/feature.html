				<li>The society we know is gone. In Sweden it is summer, a state of war. Militias control the country. Through the wilderness, Anna and her younger brother Erik cross the country. They hide in forests and fields, avoiding buildings and people
					- where death awaits.</li>

				<li>She is a war veteran, he hears a sound inside his head and sees the sun shining through the trees. The walk does not only test their endurance and ingenuity. Along the way, Anna and Erik are also forced to confront the threats within
					themselves. What happens to the trust between sister and brother when the world collapses? And where does one go when there is nowhere to escape?</li>

				<li>”Sommaren, Syster” is a film in development based on Jerker Virdborgs novel. Marcus Söderlund is currently working on the script together with Johan Wirfält.</li>
