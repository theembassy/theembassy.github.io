					The new master piece from Kortedala's suavest, the true genius of Scandinavian indie crooning, 
					the uniquely literary pop man from the west coast of every continent.<br>
					Jens said: "'I Know What Love Isn't' is my debut album. After spending a decade making records of loosely connected stories and sounds 
					I finally made an album with one story instead of ten. A story that is not new, but essentially human. 
					The story of the grey areas of love that you have to excavate and explore, using the process of elimination, 
					to maybe not find out what love is, but at least get a bit closer."<br><br>
					Service's last release. A fitting picture with somebody walking off, back turned, into the desert of the unknown.

					ARTWORK: Kristin Lidell<br>
					RECORDED BY: Brian McTear, Christian Biegai, Gary Olson, Jonas Odhner
