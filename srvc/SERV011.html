					3 Jens Lekman's Farewell Song to Rocky Dennis
				</li>
				<li>
					This limited edition (2.200) Ep is Jens Lekman´s farewell to his alias Rocky Dennis. The first track probably is the reason Jens involuntarely got his alias from the start, as someone a long time ago mistook the name in the title for the artist´s. But it actually was the name of the severely disfigured boy Rocky Dennis and the song is the story about him and his beloved blind girlfriend, in the form of a farewell letter as imagined by Jens. The movie Mask based on their true story was filmed in 1985, starring Eric Stoltz and Cher.The Ep sold out before it´s release.
