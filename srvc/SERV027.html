				One Service high point for me was when Moodymann suddenly played my favourite track from this album - Done With You - in his set on Fredsgatan in Stockhom one summer night.<br>
				After the set I happened to find Moodymann in the men's room and couldn't help but tell him I'd been loving his music since Silent Introduction, and he just replied "That's a long time."
