				<li class="txt">You hail from Gothenburg, which undoubtedly has a vivid music scene. I, personally, am most familiar with it, because of the numerous metal bands that defined the Gothenburg sound. What was your scene like when you first started? </li>

				<li></li>

				<li class="txt1">F: It was vivid. Fun, but very masculine</li>
				<li class="txt2">T: It's hard to recall but the reason we started Embassy was partly that we had the same taste in music and also because of the way we sat, with the legs twisted together like a rope. A physical bond. Our first slogan was a quote by Subway Sect - "We oppose all rock 'n' roll". So being opposed to 'rock' was clearly an issue and we defined 'rock' as stupid and conservative in contrary to 'pop' that supposed to be free and fun, a valid simplification at the time. The ambition was to connect to our readings on the musical history founded in dub, disco, post-punk and acid house and to form discussion groups on the dance floor. It all came together with the Service label, striving for a new stylish hedonism with a touch of intellectualism.</li>

				<li></li><li></li>

				<li class="txt">In your early days, you were described as having „anti-rock aesthetics and disrespectful live performances“. What was disrespectful about those?</li>

				<li></li>

				<li class="txt2">T: It was never our intention to be disrespectful but surrounded by very traditional values every good idea came out as a questioning.</li>
				<li class="txt1">F: We might have offended a few people, mostly in a good way because we took things further, but we could be real bad too. Disrespectful as in nonchalant.</li>
				<li class="txt2">T: We never rehearse so performing live is always risky. Being unprepared was a practical approach and we got away with it cos our concerts only lasted for 15 minutes, but after a while when doing 20 minute concerts we got into trouble losing focus. This led us to claim a 100 euro per minute fee for playing live, letting the promotors pay for our exposed fearfulness. Though I still think having other people performing our songs while we where drinking in the audience or "playing" on huge papier mâché instruments or not using the stage lights was good ideas. We just wanted to turn things around, like desire without presence or sincerity without authenticity and sometimes we succeeded and it was great but sometimes we where just lame and awful.</li>
				<li class="txt1">F: But as a journalist once wrote: “you never forget your first Embassy gig”.</li>

				<li></li><li></li>

				<li class="txt">The gap between your last two albums was seven years. Although, you remained active and released pretty much one single each year, what was the cause for the delay? Or is it as simple as „life happened“ (meaning family, jobs etc came into the way)?</li>

				<li></li>

				<li class="txt2">T: It's only and still is because of logistic issues, I ran away from Gothenburg. Spend 10 years in schizoanalysis to make the escape real and ended up being a shy escapist.</li>
				<li class="txt1">F: We said after the “Tacking” release that we lost belief in the album format, and only should release singles. I think the real truth was we hadn’t any good songs. Looking back, our demos 2007-9 are pretty mediocre. And around that time I recorded alone in a small room, always in technical problems, stumbled over cables, throbbing headache.. It was far from the spacious feeling from earlier years and you could hear it.</li>

				<li></li><li></li>

				<li class="txt">I noticed that all your albums have mottos like „Dry, unemotional, unlovable“ and „ Easy listening for the uneasy“. If I were to describe The Embassy to a friend, who has never heard of your before, would these descriptions fit you perfectly or would you describe yourselves in a different fashion?</li>

				<li></li>

				<li class="txt2">T: Those are descriptions of how the recordings put into context became. Altogether a general feeling about conception, ageing and dreams. So, it might not fit as a description of the music alone, it's more an estimation of our capabilities as copyrighters.</li>
				<li class="txt1">F: I really like these descriptions. I can think though - if your friend never heard of us and and ask you what we’re like and your answer is: dry, unemotional and unlovable.. Think you’d better be prepared for further questions.</li>

				<li></li><li></li>

				<li class="txt">You had a very close relationship with the Service record label. I know that Fredrik collaborated with Dan Lissvik and releasing the Crepes album „What else?“. Was it a one-time thing or are you planning to do something together in the future as well? </li>

				<li></li>

				<li class="txt1">F: No, I dunno. It was very spontaneous. Sometimes it’s fun just to start things up. Get some air into the system</li>

				<li></li><li></li>

				<li class="txt">Looking back, were you surprised that a number of indie bands cited you as a direct influence. Like the Drums or the Tough Alliance? </li>

				<li></li>

				<li class="txt2">T: Yeah, but at the same time very proud and confident about what we had to offer and that was enough then so we didn't really understand that anyone liked us. Ten years later we grew into being found of the fact that we might have been beloved but at that time the audience was gone.</li>
				<li class="txt1">F: And now their audience are gone too?</li>
				<li class="txt2">T: No, don’t think so. I heard that a Swedish festival offered TTA 20000 euro to perform live last year. With our fee system that’s a 200 minutes long concert, horrendous.</li>
				<li class="txt1">F: Once TTA were forced to play for 40 minutes on a festival so the singer had a falafel on stage. The gig was so long they had to have a lunchbreak.
</li>

				<li></li><li></li>

				<li class="txt">I know that scenes and trends change every 5-7 years. What is the most exciting thing that is going on in Gothenburg right now? Or in Swedish music scene in general?</li>

				<li></li>

				<li class="txt2">T: Oh, how embarrassing but I haven't heard any Swedish music in 3 years and it's a relief. But there's lots of great poets, like Athena Farrokhzad, Viktoria Jäderling and Elis Burrau, poetry might be the new pop. </li>
				<li class="txt1">F: I think standup is the new pop. It’s still pretty dull looking, need to add some style and diversity into the scene, but it got the disrespectfulness and action music once had. About the music scene.. Gothenburg has a label called Höga Nord. They release a lot. I like thier attitude and how they present things. They have taken the swedish music scene into a more eccentric way.</li>

				<li></li><li></li>

				<li class="txt">You once said that you choose your live performances carefully. What was it about the Schilling festival that made you agree to perform there in July? </li>

				<li></li>

				<li class="txt2">T: Wanted to go to the Baltic states for a long time, next to Benelux it's my favourite EU-place. Fantastic names, Baltic, Benelux.. </li>
				<li class="txt1">F: Fun to see Estonia. And the festival seemed good. Chill</li>

				<li></li><li></li>

				<li class="txt">What can the audience expect from The Embassy? Some sort of disrespectfulness or something completely different? </li>

				<li></li>

				<li class="txt2">T: Absolutely not disrespectful, we will play our best songs in the best possible ways. It will be funky, highlife, lowlife and coy.</li>

				<li></li><li></li>

				<li class="txt">Time for two traditional questions: what have you been listening to the most lately?</li>

				<li></li>

				<li class="txt2">T: Been possessed by Adonis "No way back", listen to it every day. Others than that Vivien Goldman, Scientist and Wizkid.</li>
				<li class="txt1">F: The Associates and Michel Houellebecq</li>

				<li></li><li></li>

				<li class="txt">Since our website is called in translation Track Nr 7, then I would like to know, what is your favorite track nr 7? (Any genre, any artist, but the track must be 7th on that album).</li>

				<li></li>

				<li class="txt1">F. Chief Inspector by Wally Badarou</li>
				<li class="txt2">T: Ecstacy by New Order</li>
