					– How do you get back into society!?
					<br><br>
					The Embassy, quite correctly called ”these overlooked architects of some of the past decade's best new sounds” by Pitchfork, are without a doubt one of the most influential Swedish bands of the 21:st century. Their Futile Crimes (2002)
					opened a new era in Swedish music, that was crowned with Tacking (2005). Their light and elegant sound, subtle melodics and sharp lyrics, blending acoustic and digital elements is in many ways a model for contemporary music.
					<br><br>
					However, The Embassy’s place in history is rathert based on their constant turn away from the contemporary. The retrospective collection Life in the Trenches (2011) reminded that they had always been to war against the actual present and
					the
					current values. The Embassy bribed journalists, watched as their concerts were performed by karaoke singers, printed photos of other bands on their record sleeves, auctioned their new releases on eBay, coded bots to stream their music on
					Spotify etc. They deconstructed, mirrored, desinformed and monkeywrenched. Turning the functionality of technology against itself, they deconstruct and show that - just like the monkeywrench - reason can undo what it has closed.
					<br><br>
					The new album White Lake is released along with vinyl issues of their classics Futile Crimes and Tacking. But how does something like The Embassy return? These pop saboteurs are neither ”timeless” nor contemporary, but always
					untimely. Therefor, The Embassy returns to the present only through a black hole in time and space: – Up your arse!
